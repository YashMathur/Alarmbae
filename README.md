# Alarmbae

## Inspiration
On May 28, 2016, a three-year-old boy climbed into a gorilla enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden and was grabbed and dragged by Harambe, a 17-year-old Western lowland gorilla. Fearing for the boy's life, a zoo worker shot and killed Harambe.

## What it does
Sets a max volume meme alarm that you won't be able to turn off unless you find twenty cubes in the VR space

## How we built it
We used google and stack overflow

## Challenges we ran into
We don't run into challenges. Getting images to show up in VR with android (GVRView) instead of working with Unity

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We made it work, which was a very surprising revelation. We resurrected Harambe.

## What we learned
We learned VR development in Android and setting up epic meme alarms.

## What's next for Alarmbae
Instead of finding 20 cubes, find the corresponding meme (to the alarm) in a plethora of memes in VR.
